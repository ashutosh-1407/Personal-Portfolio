        <p>Co-Founder & COO, Since June 2019</p>
        <p>New York, NY</p>
        <p>Civics Unplugged is a 501(c)(3) social enterprise and digitally-powered community that provides leaders of Generation Z training, funds, and support to build the future of American democracy.

In January 2020, we launched the CU Fellowship, which is our six-month, digital-first leadership program through which 200 exceptional high school-aged leaders, representing every region of America, come together to learn systems thinking, personal development, and participatory democracy.

The Fellowship culminates in the Fellows coming together in June 2020 to launch "Civics 2030," a national campaign to mobilize funds and support for leaders of Gen Z to spearhead projects that strengthen American democracy.</p>
